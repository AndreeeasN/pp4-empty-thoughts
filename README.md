# Empty Thoughts (Name to be changed?)
[Empty Thoughts](https://empty-thoughts-071e97396088.herokuapp.com/) is a platform where you can freely express and share those fleeting thoughts that occur right before falling asleep, in the shower, or during that long daily commute.
Many of these thoughts go unused or unspoken, yet they often hold a certain charm and potential.
Empty Thoughts provides you with a canvas to voice these ideas, whether it's a profound insight, a small giggle-worthy joke or simply an empty thought.

## UX

### User Demographic

Empty Thoughts was built to give a voice to unspoken ideas and untapped ideas that otherwise would have been lost to time.
Meant for anyone with the capacity to dream but lacking a creative outlet, think of it as a chaotic collective diary where drifting thoughts can find a home.
With the freedom to post anonymously, even the extraordinarily silly or embarrassing can be shared without fear.
